# UEBUI---Braille-alphabet-Views-for-UIKit
Braille alphabet Views for UIKit

UEBUI allows you to implement visual braille representations. 
UEBUI does not use any image assets. It's all drawn with UIKiit.
You are welcome to contribute in any way you see fit. For example
Right now we only have UEB (Universal English Braille), 
if someone is willing to make other language varients extensions of this famework that would be nice.

# Upcomming changes
We still havn't packaged this into a swift package. That is in my To Do list.
